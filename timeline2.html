                                    <h3>First Flight</h3>
                                    <p>On December 17th, 1903, a remarkable event occurred. The Wright Brothers took to the skies in a powered airplane for the first time. While people had flown before in hot air balloons or gliders, the Wright Brothers were the first to have a controlled and sustained flight with an engine and a human. This invention exploded the possibilities of the world from travel to warfare and most things in between. The airplane has been a resounding success all over the world for the past century as an avenue for which crises could be solved. In the span of less than 20 years, the airplane was off fighting battles in foregin lands in World War I. The plane found itself deploying both aid and harm, the former in events like the Berlin Airlift and the ladder in dropping bombs over cities. It also opened up the world to travel and cultural diffusion as never before was it so easy and fast to go far distances. The airplane created an entire industry, the aerospace industry. And with it, came incredible </p>

                                    <h3>Commercial Flight</h3>
                                    <p>Two different dates are given for the start of commercial flights, the first being in 1918 with the first airmail flight, and the second being 1926 with the first official flight with a commercial airline passenger. Airmail was super important because it allowed millions of pieces of mail to be delivered much quicker than before. It wasn’t until the government privatized the system and allowed companies to bid on carriers with the Kelly Act of 1925 that the airline industry we know today started to develop. This change encouraged growth and profit with major carriers. The first commercial flight in 1926 was done by Western Air Express, and the flight took the passengers from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles. At first, air travel was actually slower than train travel since they had to refuel and the planes couldn't fly very high, but in the 30s, key technological advancements were made that allowed for faster, better flights. Eventually, the US aviation industry became one of the largest single markets in the world, making up over ⅓ of the world's total air traffic. Since its creation, commercial aviation, whether used for mail or passenger carrying, has had a tremendous impact on the world. It has been used to send messages during war time and has facilitated world trade and economic growth. Where the world was once separated by oceans, this system allowed for connections to be made between every corner of the globe.</p>

                                    <h3>Drones</h3>
                                    <p>The first concept of drones dates back to 1849, but it wasn’t until 1935 when it was announced that “the first modern drone” had been built. Drones were originally designed as remote-guided aerial missile deployers for military use and aerial target practice. These flying robots are either remote controlled or they fly autonomously via software-controlled flight plans coded into their system. In the picture shown here, we see one of the early drones testing its vertical landing in 1923. The designer of this flying machine, George de Bothezat, had built four motors into an unmanned aerial vehicle, hence the name “quadcopter”. This quadcopter was made to help fix any manual problems that military pilots had with vertical landing by allowing the copter to do it automatically. In the aerospace industry, drones have created jobs and brought in billions of dollars to the economy; they have also made drastic improvements to military warfare & government missions. Over time, they’ve become useful in aspects of life other than dropping missiles in war and improving landing techniques. Today, many companies, and even civilians, use drones for monitoring climate change, delivering packaged goods, aiding in search and rescue operations, and filming and photography.</p>

                                    <p>The first artificial satellite that was successfully launched into low Earth-orbit was Sputnik 1 by the U.S.S.R. on October 4th, 1957. The satellite was a metal sphere, 23 inches in diameter with 4 external radio antennas that transmitted radio pulses back to earth. The importance of Sputnik 1 is that it opened the door for the possibility of man made satellites into space. Which was further proven by the U.S.’s own satellite being launched only 4 months later. In the present, we have satellites high in Earth’s orbit that we use for other aeronautical/aerospace achievements such as GPS (Global Positioning System). </p>

                                    <p>Directly after World War II, an arms and space race between the United States and the USSR commenced in what is known as the Cold War. With the first satellite and man in space, the Sovietes appeared to be winning that race. So America developed the Apollo Missions, a series of flights to space to land humans on the moon and bring them back safely. This was first accomplished on July 20, 1969 when Apollo 11 successfully touched down on the lunar surface and Neil Armstrong became the first man to walk on the moon. The Cold War pushed the government into massive spending focused especially on space. President John F. Kennedy is famous for saying, “We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.” The United States was responding to the crisis of the Cold War to maintain its dominance leading to technologies being developed at an incredible rate.</p>

                                    <p>Since the first World War, military planes have been a primary driver behind aviation innovation. Pictured above is the Lockheed F-117, better known as the Nighthawk. The strange shape is designed specifically to deflect radar making the plane almost undetectable. The smallest deviation from the tight tolerances, such as a bolt sticking too far out of the frame, can lead to the plane being obvious on radar. It is an incredible feat of engineering, precision, and autonomous driving as the plane's strange shape makes it nearly impossible to pilot without the assistance of computers. Developed and first flown on June 18th of 1981, it is the ultimate culmination of scientific principle with modern technology.</p>

                                    <p>Mars Pathfinder was a U.S. spacecraft that landed a base station with a rover on Mars on July 4, 1997. It consisted of a lander and a small 10.6 kilograms wheeled robotic rover named Sojourner, which was the first rover to operate on the surface of Mars. The Mars Pathfinder mission was designed to demonstrate a low-cost method for delivering a set of science instruments and to return geological, soil, magnetic property and atmospheric data from the Red Planet. It was the first wheeled vehicle to be used on any other planet in the solar system and served as the foundation for many future aerospace missions such as the Mars rovers we see today. Pathfinder demonstrated a number of innovative, economical, and highly effective approaches to spacecraft and mission design. This had a huge impact in the aerospace industry because the mission led to multiple scientific discoveries about the red planet, including Panoramic images of Pathfinder's landing site at Ares Vallis and the presence of rounded pebbles and cobbles suggested that Mars had a warmer, wetter past.</p>
