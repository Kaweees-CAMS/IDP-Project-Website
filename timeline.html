                                    <h3>Interchangeable Parts</h3>
                                    <p>In 1798, Eli Whitney began production of the first firearms with interchangeable parts. Interchangeable parts, or standardized parts, were parts that were identical to each other and were substitutable. Their invention are largely credited to Whitney, though they were proven to have existed previously. Nevertheless, their manufacturing was largely popularized by Whitney.  This innovation to traditional manufacturing required less skilled workers and sped up production times significantly. In comparison to previous methods of gunmaking, which required great skill, this innovation streamlined the process, saving time and money.</p>

                                    <h3>Steam Engine</h3>
                                    <p>In 1802, Richard Trevitchick patented the “high pressure engine” and created the first steam-powered locomotive engine on railroads. This steam engine uses hot steam from boiling water to drive a piston(s) back and forth until the movement of the piston powers a machine or turns a wheel. It was invented to allow people to travel on land faster than they could on a horse, transporting supplies and passengers. During a test run of his engine in 1804, Trevithick wrote: "[the engine] carry'd ten tons of Iron, five wagons, and 70 Men...above 9 miles...in 4 hours and 5 Mints." The steam engine helped power the industrial revolution, giving people the ability to build factories anywhere with a more reliable power source for bigger machines. Through the years, the creation of the steam engine has enhanced productivity and technology, making way for inventions of smaller and more efficient engines. This led to transportation improvements; the engines were being used for more than just trains, as boats, farms, and road vehicles all became users of this manufacturing technology.</p>

                                    <h3>Electricity</h3>
                                    <p>Electricity is the physical phenomena associated with the presence and flow of electric charge. In 1752, Benjamin Franklin flew a kite tied to a key in a thunderstorm to prove that static electricity and lightning were the same thing. Although it was not all discovered at once, this experiment sparked the journey of electricity. In 1800, an Italian scientist named Alessandro Volta produced the first electric current to create a battery. When people started focusing on electric lighting, the real breakthrough occurred. In the 1860’s, there was just a small ball of light without much power. In 1879, Thomas Edison wanted to create a light bulb that could last a long time before burning out. Edison went on to patent his first electric light, stating that it uses “devices whereby the heat arising from the passage of [the] current is utilized to regulate the temperature of the incandescent metal which serves to give the light so that it is never allowed to reach its melting point no matter how strong a current attempts to pass through.” He describes his invention as indestructible, making it extremely popular and paving the way for engineering in the future. Electricity brought a sense of organization to production factories in the manufacturing industry. Companies were able to open up electrical power plants to power big cities. Discoveries surrounding electricity set off a chain reaction leading to huge growth in the industrial revolution. Inventions like the telegraph, telephone, and radio were all made possible because of electricity. By 1925, half of all homes had electric lighting in their homes. By the 1950’s, there was a high demand for vacuums, refrigerators, washing machines, etc. Today, we continue to study and improve electric designs, using natural gas, fossil fuels, and nuclear power for our electricity.</p>

                                    <p>The assembly line was first used in 1913 by the Ford Motor Company for the production of their Model T car. The assembly line, installed by Henry Ford, is a process used in production in which products are assembled in a specific sequence in quick succession. This process reduced production times drastically; a Model T, which typically took 12 hours to produce, was done in one hour and 33 minutes using this method.</p>

                                    <h3>Nanotechnology</h3>
                                    <p>The concept of nanotechnology was created by physicist Rechard Feynman at an American Physical Society meeting at CalTech on December 29th of 1959. With the basic idea of allowing scientists to control as well as manipulate atoms and particles individually on the molecular level. It wouldn’t be until 1981 where the term “nanotechnology” would be coined by Professor Norio Taniguch of the Tokyo University of Science. With the term nano itself meaning/referring to any material between one and 100 nanometers in size. The importance of nanotechnology to the manufacturing industry being that it allows the manufacturer to use a wider range of specialized materials for certain products. Like the polymer nanocomposites found in tires that allow for their high-resistance and grip or the composite parts needed in space shuttles which are necessary for the aerospace industry.</p>

                                    <h3>CAD</h3>
                                    <p>In the early 1960s the first commercially available Computer Aided Design (CAD) systems were coming out to the public market. Initially they were used mostly by aerospace, engineering, and information technology companies. The first CAD software was developed in 1957 when Dr. Patrick J. Hanratty developed Design Automated by Computer (DAC), the first commercial numerical-control programming system. Soon after, more advanced CAD softwares were developed.  This development is important because CAD enables the development, modification, and optimization of the design process. Thanks to CAD, engineers can make more accurate representations and modify them easily to improve design quality. The development of CAD software has left a lasting impact on the Manufacturing Industry. Thanks to CAD, manufacturing is far more efficient and reliable than ever before. It is believed that CAD will continue to shape Engineering Industries</p>

                                    <h3>Just in Time Production</h3>
                                    <p>Just in time production, also known as lean production, is a manufacturing process in which inventory does not sit idle and products are made as they are ordered. This philosophy was adopted in the 1970s by Taiichi Ohno from the Toyota Motor Corporation. Just in time production reduces production times, lowers storage costs for inventory, and typically produces better quality products. This process contrasts from “just in case” manufacturing, in which products are made in advance, predicting consumer interests. While both have their advantages, a disadvantage to “just in case” manufacturing addressed by lean manufacturing is the overproduction of goods.</p>

                                    <p>The first mention of a ´layer by layer´approach to manufacturing came from Dr Hideo Kodama in May of 1981, but it wasn´t until 1984 with Charles Hull that the first 3D printer was actually made. This tool used Stereolithography, a process that uses a spout to dispense liquid polymer while using a laser to instantly harden the material in place, allowing for 3D objects to be made. Although initially created back in the 80s, it didn’t become a prominent manufacturing technique in the industry until the 2000s. The process went through many different developments in this time but the main purpose of the strategy remained the same, to create complex structures with much higher efficiency than ever seen before. This creation has had a huge impact on the industry, some people even going so far as to say it's the future of manufacturing. Compared to earlier methods, additive manufacturing is much less labor intensive, produces less waste, can create more complex geometries, and has a lot more applications (such as bioprinting). The creation of 3D printing has allowed for many more advancements to be made in the field and many more are expected to come.</p>

                                    <p>Automation brings safer, more reliable, and cheaper alternatives to employees. Big brands such as Tesla use automation to bring down the cost of employees and increase efficiency. Today, automation can be seen in almost anything from home appliances to large industrial assembly lines. Automation is the future of the world. Without the need for employees humans will have a much easier life.</p>

                                    <h3>The Future of Engineering</h3>
                                    <p>The future of pandemic/crisis response as well as the engineering industry as a whole is looking very bright. Experts say that we are now far more prepared for crises in the future and have well thought out plans for how to respond/adjust to them. Many companies now have procedures put in place for when it is mandatory that people must work from home, and even then, many businesses have thought of plans to accommodate for future social distancing.  When it comes to engineering as a whole, many new technological advancements are expected: many trips are planned for space exploration, 3D printing is anticipated to be used in a wider variety of applications, and robotics is expected to have a larger role in manufacturing. As time goes on and new ideas are developed, we can expect more advantageous improvements to be made in the field of engineering.</p>
